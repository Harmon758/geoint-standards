# National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) Web Map Tile Service 1.0.0 Interoperability Standard, Version 1.1 (2018-04-27)  


The NSG WMTS Interoperability Standard provides an interface to serve digital maps using predefined image tiles. It complements the existing NSG Web Map Service (WMS) standard. This NSG profile seeks to maximize commonality and improve interoperability across different standards. To this end, the coordinate reference systems and projections are the same for the NSG Profiles of WMS and WMTS. In addition, the coordinate reference systems, projections, and tiling schemes are the same for the NSG Profiles of WMTS and GeoPackage.  

This Interoperability Standard, also known as a profile, identifies and tailors the implementable provisions prescribed for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) for a Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service Implementation Standard; Reference Number OGC 07-057r7, version 1.0.0 dated 2010-04-06.

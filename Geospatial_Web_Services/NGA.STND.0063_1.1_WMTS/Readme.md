National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) Web Map Tile Service 1.0.0 Interoperability Standard, Version 1.1 (2018-04-27)


The NSG WMTS Interoperability Standard provides an interface to serve digital maps using predefined image tiles. It complements the existing NSG Web Map Service (WMS) standard. This NSG profile seeks to maximize commonality and improve interoperability across different standards. To this end, the coordinate reference systems and projections are the same for the NSG Profiles of WMS and WMTS. In addition, the coordinate reference systems, projections, and tiling schemes are the same for the NSG Profiles of WMTS and GeoPackage.

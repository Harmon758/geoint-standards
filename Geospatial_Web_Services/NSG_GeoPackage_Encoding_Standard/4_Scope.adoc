2.	Scope
This interoperability standard defines NSG implementable provisions that profile the  OGC GeoPackage standard to ensure that NSG GeoPackages,GeoPackage SQLite Extensions, and supporting utilities and services fulfill their intended purposes and are fit for use.    
This interoperability standard will be used by government, commercial, open source other NGO:
•	Data Providers to deliver NSG GeoPackage data files, not software.  They may employ software provided by both Infrastructure Providers and Application Software Providers.  Infrastructure Providers.
•	Infrastructure Software Providers to deliver software that implements the SQLite engine, GeoPackage SQLite Extensions,  GeoPackage libraries  and/or stand alone GeoPackage utilities or web services to encode/decode, validate, and manage GeoPackage files.
•	Application Software Providers to deliver GeoPackage “Apps” that provide users with the capabilities they require in general or mission-specific environments .  They may employ software provided by Infrastructure Providers and bundle their Apps with GeoPackages from Data Providers.
•	DoD/IC Procurement Organizations to acquire conformant GeoPackages, infrastructure, and applications.
Architects, systems and software engineers, developers, and data modelers of the NSG and its component systems/applications in these roles will promote uniform geospatial data access, GeoPackage and GeoPackage SQLite Extension development and use.  The goal is to increase interoperability, modularity, and agility of applications within the NSG.  This interoperability standard is an adjunct to the base standard profiled – not a stand-alone document.
This document requires adherence to all GeoPackage OGC Specification normative clauses and normative annexes, and to the normative provisions herein that restrict and extend the clauses summarized in Table 1 below and listed in detail in the embedded spreadsheet in Table 4 below.

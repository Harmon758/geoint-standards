<h2> 5. Compliance </h2>  

NSG compliance to this profile is as prescribed in Table 4. For convenience and ease of use, Table 4 is provided as an embedded file in Microsoft Excel format and displayed as an icon. The first tab contains column heading descriptions, the second tab contains normative keywords, and the third tab contains all the normative statements along with other interoperability standard information. The NSG compliance test for GeoPackage 1.0 is based on Annex A in the GeoPackage Encoding Standard and the implementable provisions in this profile.   Test details are provided in the Compliance Test/Measure column. The NSG compliance test only tests the provisions for which a test is required and feasible.  See the applicability statement in paragraph four of Clause 2 Scope above.

OGC develops test suites for the vendors to use as a part of the OGC’s Compliance Interoperability Test and Evaluation (CITE) certification program. The NSG compliance test for GeoPackage 1.0 will be based on the same software used for OGC’s CITE test engines. The NSG compliance test suite for GeoPackage 1.0 is currently under development.  

In addition to the NSG compliance test, this NSG profile is intended to be used during interoperability events to assess the compliance of vendors’ implementations to the NSG interoperability standard. This interoperability standard will be used as a part of a planned Conformance Assessment and Interoperability Testing Program to certify that vendors’ products are compliant with the NSG interoperability standard.  

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provides certification for its members against OGC specifications. OGC normally does not perform the testing, relying instead on the results provided by the vendors.  In a similar fashion, a vendor will run the NSG compliance test against their application and provide the test results to the Conformance Assessment and Interoperability Testing Program. Those results will in turn, generally be accepted by the Conformance Assessment and Interoperability Testing Program; the compliance test results for NSG GeoPackage 1.0 serve as objective proof of NSG interoperability standard compliance.

# Metadata Focus Group (MFG)
The Metadata Focus Group (MFG) deals with those aspects of the standardization of GEOINT relating to imagery, sensor and geospatial metadata. Metadata is used by a large population of users other than the producer of the metadata. Usually, it is created by someone and used by someone else. Standardizing the structure and use of metadata will provide creators with appropriate information to characterize the data. Furthermore, standardizing the use of metadata will enable users to effectively implement the metadata to facilitate the most efficient method to discover and retrieve the associated data. 

The MFG coordinates activities between the various recognized organizations and assumes a leading role in the development of standardized metadata in their respective communities. The organizations currently taking an active role in these activities include but are not limited to: 

* American National Standards Institute – InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standardization/Geographic Information (ANSI – INCITS/L1) 
* Digital Geographic Information Working Group (DGIWG) 
* Distributed Common Ground Systems Multi-Service Execution Team Metadata Working Group (DCGS MET MWG) 
* Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC) 
* Intelligence Community Metadata Working Group (IC MWG) 
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee 211 (TC 211) 
* Multinational Geospatial Co-Production Group (MGCP) 
* NATO Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Capability Group (JISRCG) 
* Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 
* Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) 

NGA-DCGS Metadata Harmonization Team's Metadata Monthly articles are now being published on the DOD Metadata Registry (DOD MDR).

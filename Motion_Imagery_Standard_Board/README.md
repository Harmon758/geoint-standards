# Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) 
In 2000, the NGA Innovision Directorate stood up the Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB), effectively establishing an official standards body responsible for reviewing and recommending standards for motion imagery, associated metadata, audio and other related systems for use within the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, and United States Imagery and Geospatial System (DoD/IC/USIGS).

Motion Imagery is recognized by the Intelligence and Defense communities as a vital part of our current and future intelligence picture. As our ability to collect motion imagery and achieve persistent surveillance continues to grow, ensuring interoperability of motion imagery formats with other types of sensor outputs, and making that critical intelligence available to those who need to know becomes increasingly important.

# Intent
The GEOINT Standards Working Group (GWG) is a National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) forum that serves the Director, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the NGA Chief Information Officer who is the delegated functional manager for GEOINT architecture and standards, in executing the functional management responsibilities authorized in NSG Directive FM 1100, August 2, 2014. The GWG provides the forum for the coordination of GEOINT standard activities. The GWG is led and chaired by the NGA's Geospatial Intelligence Standards Center of Excellence (GSCOE). 

In addition to its designation as an NSG Functional Management forum, the GWG is a Joint Technical Working Group that participates in both the DoD and IC standards governance processes. In the DoD, the GWG votes and manages GEOINT standards lifecycle recommendations reported to the Information Technology Standards Committee (ITSC), the governing group responsible for developing and promoting standards interoperability in support of net-centricity within the Department of Defense (DoD). GWG recommendations for mandating standards for the DoD are approved by the DoD Architecture and Standards Review Group (ASRG). Approved GEOINT standards are then cited in the DoD Information Technology (IT) Standards Registry (DISR) [Account and PKI/CAC required]. 

The NSG Standards Registry supports the discovery, traceability, and lifecycle management of GEOINT Standards that may be used in the development and operation of data- and net-centric GEOINT applications.  Please see: http://nsgreg.nga.mil

NGA aims to co-create and grow NSG GEOINT standards transparently and provide an environment where GEOINT standards are co-located with code development.  This is NGA's first experiment using GitHub, beyond source code development, as a document co-creation system.

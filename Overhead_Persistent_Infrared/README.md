# Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR)
The Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Focus Group works issues across functional domains concerning OPIR data and metadata standards development in support of fostering net-centric data services. The OFG is co-chaired by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in concert with the United States Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Commander for Space, U.S. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). The OFG was formed to improve support to operations and intelligence by exposing OPIR data in a net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

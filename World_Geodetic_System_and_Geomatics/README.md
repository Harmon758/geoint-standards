# World Geodetic System and Geomatics Focus Group (WGSG FG) 
The purpose of the World Geodetic System (WGS) and Geomatics Focus Group is to serve as a National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) community-based forum to advocate for and manage the standardization of the World Geodetic System and activities related to its implementation which enable the provision of timely, relevant, and accurate geo-referenced data and information.

The WGS and Geomatics (WGSG) Focus Group will define and resolve interoperability and related standardization issues, and act as a conduit for information and coordination as related to the WGS and the discipline of Geomatics.

The WGS is a set of conventions, parameters, and geophysical models that define a geodetic coordinate reference system for the Earth. The various models and conventions link the basic geometric coordinate systems to the dynamic physical living world. For additional informational regarding the WGS refer to:

[MIL-STD-2401(1)](https://nsgreg.nga.mil/doc/view?i=2058), Department of Defense World Geodetic System, 1994, with Change Notice 1 
TR8350.2, Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984, Definition and Relationships with Local Geodetic Systems

Geomatics is a discipline that integrates data acquisition, modeling, analysis, and the management of spatially referenced data based on the scientific framework of geodesy, geophysics, geotechnical analysis, photogrammetry, elevation, orbital sciences, and bathymetry. Geomatics uses terrestrial, marine, airborne, and satellite-based sensors, i.e. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), to create and manage authoritative spatially referenced data tied to Earth Fixed Earth Centered (EFEC) and inertial reference systems which have well defined accuracy characteristics.

The following tables identify standards citations in the Joint Enterprise Standards Committee ([JESC](https://nsgreg.nga.mil/JESC-approved.jsp)) that are managed by this GWG Focus Group, as well as non-cited standards-related documents that have been determined by this Focus Group to be important to the successful creation, discovery, exchange, and/or use of GEOINT data, information, services, and applications in the NSG.

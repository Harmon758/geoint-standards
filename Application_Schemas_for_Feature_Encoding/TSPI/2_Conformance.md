<h2>2	Conformance</h2>
<p>Conformance to this specification ensures that XML instance documents are both well-formed (meet syntactic requirements) and valid (meet logical requirements) with respect to the requirements of the TSPI Schema, and in the case of a TSPI Schema-conformant application whether it correctly writes and/or reads TSPI Schema-conformant instance documents.<br><br>
Conformance with the TSPI specification shall be determined using all of the relevant tests and conditions specified in Annex B. The TSPI Schema includes multiple XML namespaces (see Section 1.9) all of which are included in conformance testing.<br><br>
The TSPI Schema supports a range of existing and future business practices for time-space-position information specification and exchange within the NSG. In this specification some of these practices are deprecated while others are recommended. These identifications shall be considered as advisory in nature; their adoption is a policy decision that falls outside the scope of this specification. Individual COIs need to determine what policies they will adopt when employing the TSPI Schema.<br><br>
Future versions of the TSPI specification may include stronger policy language and/or remove representation and encoding options to ensure that communities of practice within the NSG more rapidly converge on a small set of widely adopted business practices.</p><br><br>

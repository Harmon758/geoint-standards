# Application Schemas for Feature Encoding Focus Group (ASFE FG)
Feature encoding is defined as the conversion of data into a series of codes. The Application Schemas for Feature Encoding (ASFE) Focus Group is responsible for those aspects of the standardization of GEOINT relating to data structures, exchange and storage of geospatial intelligence. This includes data format, feature and attribute coding schemes, exchange media, administrative procedures, representations of geographic feature geometry, feature attribution information, and other geographic information. The ASFE FG coordinates its activities with the other GWG focus groups, as well as with other Technical Working Groups (TWG) under the Information Technology Standards Committee (ITSC).

The ASFE FG is specifically responsible for the development of the [GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile (GSIP)](https://nsgreg.nga.mil/gsip/). The GSIP consists of an interdependent set of components that together define a common method for specifying and encoding GEOINT and related geospatial (e.g., Common Operational Picture and METOC) data in the NSG.
